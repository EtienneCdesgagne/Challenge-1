# Challenge 1 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

**On-the-job ticket**
I was provided starter code for a marketing agency
This project is to go through an HTML&CSS file and refactor it due to bugs and optimize its code for better use. I did this to make the code easier to use in the future, lots of it was repetitive and made the file bigger than it needed to be. It also makes future changes easier due to navigation throughout the file being more streamlined. I got lots of practice working with css classes and Ids using them to apply large amounts of style elements throughout the file.
